I made a car on the screen that follows your mouse around. It's made up of simple rectangles
and circles. To get the car moving, I tried out two very plain tricks. The first trick was to move
each part bit by bit. The second trick was to link all the parts together with the code commands
push() and pop(), and then slide the whole car around with another command called translate().
Details of the codes are written down below for further description.
