Click and poof! A circle pops up right where you click your mouse. I've coded it so that every time you
click the mouse, the circle() function that I’ve added in the mousePress() function draws new circles
for spot on the screen. And guess what? If you hit any key on the keyboard, the circles disappear,
allowing for a fresh start.
