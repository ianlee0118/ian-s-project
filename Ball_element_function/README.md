This one is also similar to the previous Ball Series, but again, I had fun mixing things up
with the code. I created my own functions this time. There's a “display function” that shows
what the ball looks like, a “bounce function" that tells the ball what to do when it hits
a wall, and a “move function” that keeps the ball rolling. I put all these functions together
and called them in the draw section. It's like having a toolbox for the ball, each tool doing
a different job.
