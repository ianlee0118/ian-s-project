This is the familiar ‘digital pen’ moment. Basically, I used the “present” or “current” mouse = mouse X,
and mouse Y and the “past”, “history” mouse = mouseX, pmouseY to differentiate the current and past
drawings. However, I think the coolest part is that when you want to start over, you just click the mouse
and it erases the whole drawing. This becomes a continuous theme in my later works.
