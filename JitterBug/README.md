Meet the jittering balls! They keep jittering around because I keep adding random values to their
movement. I turned this jittery action into a function and made four of them, each with a different
name. These are what I call objects. It's so much fun seeing them move that I want to add a whole
bunch more, and no, I refuse to call them fidgeting balls!
