Here, I’ve added even more so that when the ball hits the boxes, the boxes can explode.
However, they don’t explode right away. I set up the game to detect when the ball touches
a box and then make the box shatter based on certain conditions. Before I figured this out,
any contact between the ball and a box would cause an instant explosion, which looked a bit
odd. Now, it depends on how hard the ball hits the box, making the game feel more realistic
and exciting.
