I wanted to create a scene where balls drop and bounce around. So, I thought about controlling
each ball separately and making it look like they're following real-world physics, but that
seemed really complex. Then I discovered there's a JavaScript library for physics called
matter.js. It seems like just the tool I need, but I'll have to study it a bit more to use
it effectively.
