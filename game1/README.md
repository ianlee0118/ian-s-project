Since I’ve learned about matter.js which has the physics engine that I’m most intrigued by,
I wanted to try making a game. This game is simple. When you press a rectangular shape,
a rectangle of one of many different sizes drops. When you press a circular shape, a circle
appears and then settles on the bottom of the screen. When you press anything with an X mark,
that shape type disappears, leaving the other shape only.
The most difficult part of this was combining P5.js with matter.js. My code got really long
and it took a lot of time.
