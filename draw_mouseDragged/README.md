Imagine your mouse is a ‘digital pen’, but a ‘lagged’ one. When you drag your mouse, little
circles are dragged wherever your mouse goes. I made it happen by using the circle() trick
inside the mouseDragged() function. So, as you drag the mouse, circles follow. And if you feel
like starting over, just tap a key on your keyboard, and poof! The background clears, and
the circles vanish.
