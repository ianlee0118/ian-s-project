This part was all about practicing how to make a function. I made one that draws a face. To get
it to work, you need to feed it six different variables when you call it. These variables let
you change where the face is, how big it is, and what color it is. It's like having a control
panel for drawing a cartoon face, and I call him Jeffrey.
