I now wanted to create features that are exist in real games, and my top priority was an explosion
(but a peaceful one)! There’s a red box. When you click on it, it looks like it bursts into many
pieces. It’s obvious, but I made the original big red box disappear once it’s clicked and lots
of smaller boxes appear, moving around in disorder.
