When you press anywhere in the gray box, moving circles of different shapes appear. The fun
begins when these circles move and bump into each other, and then they change color to white.
When they move apart and don’t touch each other again, they turn back to black. They're
playing a game of tag with colors, changing every time they touch and then go their separate ways.
