This game is the result of my continuous programming studies. After getting the game
mechanics down, I added soothing music and sound effects, too. The gameplay is intuitive:
press the first button on the screen to create a box, and the second one to create a ball.
The third button clears everything. You can use the first and second buttons to build
structures with boxes and balls, moving them around with your mouse. You can also try to
click and drag on any box and see what happens. To switch to destroy mode, just press
the ‘a’ key. If you want to go back to building, either press the first or second button
again, or switch modes with the ‘s’ key. It's a mix of creativity and destruction,
all in one game.
