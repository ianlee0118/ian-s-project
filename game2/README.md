I now wanted to make a game where I can grab and move an object with my mouse, which I think
is an essential game feature. I had to do some research on the matter.js website to figure
out how to make it work. One tricky part was making the shapes interact with each other,
like bumping into one another. Setting up things like collision filters and categories was
confusing at first, but after playing around with them, I got it to work. It's amazing how
these little adjustments can add physical “activity” to simple drawings.
