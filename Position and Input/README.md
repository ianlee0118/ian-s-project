There’s a line in the middle and depending on where you lay your mouse, the background color
changes. If the mouse is on the left side of the line, the background turns red; if it's on the
right, it turns blue. The moment you click on the mouse, the background color turns green.
This is where I learned about the “if()” function. It's like a decision maker for the computer.
Simply put, I am ordering the computer: “IF.. so and so happens.. THEN do that”. I believe this
function will be very useful and it seems very important for coding.
