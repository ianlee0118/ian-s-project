I tried using the “for()” loop for the first time here. “For()” is all about repetitive actions.
You set a condition, and the action repeats told until the condition is met. In this case, even
though the circular shapes look like they’re constant and the colors are the only things that
are changing, I actually made both the shapes and the colors pop up in a regular pattern and
in constant placement. I also played with something called “frameRate()” to control how fast
the code runs. Right now, it's set to 5, meaning the code does its thing 5 times every second.
