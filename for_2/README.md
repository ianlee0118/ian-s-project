I created an array and filled it with 100 elements, each having a random value. Then, I used
these elements in a function to create jittering balls. I ended up with 100 of these chaotic
jittery balls. It feels like disco balls, dancing balls, or a crowd of bouncing balls… whatever
it is, it hurts my eyes.
