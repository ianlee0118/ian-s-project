The most difficult part of this was defining what “random” was. I defined “random” as “surprise”
but limited to “color surprise”. I added random values to the colors in my old code, so it can
throw out any random colors as a surprise. It's a bit of a game, not knowing what you'll get,
but I find this pretty.
