This is the starting point of what a potential game could look like. A simple ball bouncing off
the walls. I used the if() function to make sure it doesn't go off the screen. Basically, whenever
the ball hits a wall, the if() function tells it to bounce back in a different direction. It's
like playing an endless game of ping-pong with the edges of the canvas.
